# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
An employee for the 
You have been tasked with getting key metrics from the datasets. This will involve performing calculations to get sums, averages, and percentages. Before you perform these calculations, though, you should check if the numbers in these datasets are the correct data type for making those calculations, as this is considered a best practice.

The school district summary will be a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics:

Total number of students 39,170
Total number of schools 15
Total budget $24,649,428
Average math score 79.0 (78.98537146)
Average reading score 81.9 (81.87750517)
Percentage of students who passed math 75%
Percentage of students who passed reading 86%
Overall passing percentage 65%


The school district summary after Thomas High School 9th Grade Grades were removed from the data. This is a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics:

Total number of students 38,709
Total number of schools 15
Total budget $24,649,428
Average math score 79.0 (78.93053295)
Average reading score 81.9 (81.85579581)
Percentage of students who passed math 75%
Percentage of students who passed reading 86%
Overall passing percentage 65%

Here is the list of deliverables for the analysis of the school district: 


Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate


The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
School performance based on the budget per student
School performance based on the school size 
School performance based on the type of school
Before we can begin these tasks, we need to import the datasets into Jupyter Notebook using Python.

Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type
Summary: Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.


Results:

There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data (10 pt).
Summary:

There is a statement summarizing four major changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced (5 pt).

Here is the list of deliverables for the analysis of the school district: 

A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
School performance based on the budget per student
School performance based on the school size 
School performance based on the type of school
Before we can begin these tasks, we need to import the datasets into Jupyter Notebook using Python.

The school district summary will be a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics:

Total number of students
Total number of schools
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
Percentage of students who passed math
