# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
An employee for the Education District has been tasked with getting key metrics from School District grades. The analysis was completed by performing calculations to get sums, averages, and percentages in the School District data for high school grades.
## Challenge Overview
After the school district committee reviewed the result, the school district suspected that the standardized test scores for ninth grade students at Thomas High School were somehow tampered or manipulated in some manner and they requested for the analysis to be repeated only this time excluding the grades for 9th graders in Thomas High School but the students would remain for that grade in order not to skew the other numbers in regards to budget, school size, budget per student and

## Results
Below is a more detailed analysis performed and the explanation of how they differ with the initial analysis of the data. Both math and reading scores were replaced with "NaN", which represents a "Not-a-Number" value. As a result of this change, 461 student grades were removed for math and reading respectively. Although it may seem a large number, compared to the total amount of students, the 461 only represents 1.2% of the total grades that were analyzed. 

### District Summary 
The District summary was minimally affected due to the fact that when rounding the values up the changes were so minimally that they were not reflected in the formatted data.

### School Summary
The School Summary was affected by changing the grades for Thomas High School for math and reading. This ended up improving Thomas High School grades by 25%-30% when the 9th graders were removed compared to their math and reading scores in the initial analysis. 
Thomas High School now has some of the highest passing scores compared to other schools. Below are the images for both of the results:

### Math and reading scores by Grade
The Math and Reading scores by grade were not affected. This is due to the fact that this number is calculated as an average of all the values within the school. 

### Math and Reading Passing Percentages
The passing percentages were  affected by removing the 9th graders grades for Thomas High School for math and reading. This ended up improving Thomas High School passing percentages from 25%-30%. This improved the performance of the high school by close to 30%. Below are the images for a better understanding of the changes that occurred:
